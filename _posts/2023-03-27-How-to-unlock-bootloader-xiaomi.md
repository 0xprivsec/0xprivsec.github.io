# How to unlock bootloader on Xiaomi deivces
Xiaomi devices are known for their affordability and top-notch specifications. However, unlocking the bootloader on a Xiaomi device can be quite tricky. The bootloader is the first thing that loads when you turn on your device, and it's responsible for loading the operating system. By unlocking the bootloader, you can gain root access, install custom ROMs, and perform other advanced tasks. In this blog post, we will guide you on how to unlock the bootloader on a Xiaomi device.

Before we proceed, let's take a look at the prerequisites:

A Xiaomi device
A computer running Windows or Linux
A USB cable to connect your device to the computer
Xiaomi Mi Unlock Tool - You can download it from the official Xiaomi website
An active Mi account
Developer options and USB debugging enabled on your device
Backup your data as unlocking the bootloader will wipe all data from your device
Once you have fulfilled all the prerequisites, you can proceed with the following steps:

Step 1: Enable developer options and USB debugging

To enable developer options, go to Settings > About phone > tap on MIUI version seven times. Once you see the message "You are now a developer," go back to the Settings menu, and you will see the Developer options. Scroll down to find the USB debugging option and enable it.

Step 2: Create a Mi account

If you haven't created a Mi account, create one by visiting the official Xiaomi website. Once you have created an account, log in to it on your Xiaomi device.

Step 3: Apply for Bootloader Unlocking Permission

Visit the Xiaomi Mi Unlock website and apply for bootloader unlocking permission. After applying, you may have to wait for a few days or even weeks to get approval. You will receive a message on your Mi account when your application is approved.

Step 4: Download and install Mi Unlock Tool

Download the Mi Unlock Tool on your computer and install it. Make sure to install the drivers if you are using Windows.

Step 5: Boot your Xiaomi device into Fastboot mode

To enter Fastboot mode, turn off your device and press the power button and volume down button simultaneously. Once the device is in Fastboot mode, connect it to your computer using a USB cable.

Step 6: Unlock the bootloader

Launch the Mi Unlock Tool on your computer and sign in with your Mi account. The tool will detect your device, and you can click on the "Unlock Now" button to start the process. The process may take a few minutes, and your device will reboot automatically once the bootloader is unlocked.

Congratulations! You have successfully unlocked the bootloader on your Xiaomi device. Now you can install custom ROMs, root your device, and perform other advanced tasks. Remember that unlocking the bootloader will void the warranty of your device, and it's crucial to backup your data before proceeding with the process.
