# ADB and Fastboot
If you're someone who's interested in tinkering with their Android device or wants to install a custom ROM like LineageOS, you've probably come across terms like ADB and Fastboot. These are two important tools that are essential for anyone who wants to work with Android devices beyond the basic user level. In this post, we'll go over what ADB and Fastboot are, what they do, and how you can use them. <br />

ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge, and it's a command-line tool that allows you to communicate with an Android device from your computer. With ADB, you can perform a variety of tasks like installing apps, backing up data, and even accessing the Android shell. It's a powerful tool that's used by developers, enthusiasts, and even regular users who want to get the most out of their devices. <br />

Fastboot, on the other hand, is another command-line tool that's used for flashing firmware images to an Android device's partition. It's often used for unlocking the bootloader, installing a custom recovery like TWRP, or flashing custom ROMs like LineageOS. Fastboot can also be used to access the Android bootloader and perform other low-level tasks on the device. <br />

To use ADB and Fastboot, you'll first need to install them on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to download the Android SDK Platform Tools, which includes both tools in a single package. Once you have the Platform Tools installed, you can connect your Android device to your computer via USB and start using ADB and Fastboot commands. <br />

Some common ADB commands include:<br />
```
adb devices: Lists all connected Android devices
adb shell: Opens the Android shell
adb install <path to APK>: Installs an APK file on the device
adb backup -all: Creates a backup of all apps and data on the device
```
<br />
And some common Fastboot commands include:
<br />
```
fastboot devices: Lists all connected Android devices in fastboot mode
fastboot oem unlock: Unlocks the device's bootloader
fastboot flash <partition> <firmware image>: Flashes a firmware image to a specific partition on the device
fastboot boot <recovery image>: Boots the device into a custom recovery like TWRP
```
<br />
Of course, there are many more ADB and Fastboot commands that you can use, but these are just some examples to get you started.
<br />
In conclusion, ADB and Fastboot are two powerful command-line tools that allow you to communicate with and control an Android device from your computer. They're essential for anyone who wants to tinker with their device beyond the basic user level, and they can help you unlock the full potential of your Android device. If you're interested in learning more, there are plenty of online resources and forums where you can find more information and connect with other Android enthusiasts.
