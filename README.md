# Trying to make a blog...

Hey there! I'm 0xprivsec, and I want to learn more about privacy and security. I love technology, but I'm also pretty paranoid about all the ways it can be used to track and control us. That's why I'm on a mission to learn as much as I can about keeping myself and my data safe. <br />

Recently, I decided to take the plunge and install LineageOS on a old phone. It's an open-source operating system based on Android that has a bunch of cool features for privacy and security. I'm still figuring it all out, but I'm excited to see what it can do. <br />

Along with LineageOS, I also want to learn more about security, CTF (Capture the Flag), and hacking. I'm not an expert by any means, but I think it's important to know how systems work and how they can be compromised. Plus, it's just really interesting stuff. <br />

I'm using this blog as a sort of notepad to keep track of what I'm learning, but I also want to share it with anyone who might be interested. If you're into privacy, security, or just want to learn more about these topics, then stick around! I hope I can help you out in some way, and I'm always open to feedback and suggestions.<br />
